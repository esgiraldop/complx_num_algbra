''' Tasks to do:
    - Check nothing other than digits are entered by the user
    - Check input is of the form "n + mi", where "n" is the real part and "m" the complex part
    - The user should be able to enter fractions or decimals and get the answer in both formats
    - Format the input so there are not whitespaces between terms and/or numbers
    - Check there are only two signs: One for the real part and one for the complex part
    - Numbers with decimals and fractions combined are not avoided. For example: (3.345/3.545)'''
